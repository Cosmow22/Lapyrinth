Here are ideas/tips to improve maze.py:

    Specific:
        Add Growing Forest algorithm, simplified prim, modified prim or True prim (I think i did True but i'm not sure) (https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm)
        Add Blob Division (https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2015/1/15/better-recursive-division-algorithm.html)
        Set private values
        Add an iterative or recursive version of algorithms that doesn't have both version

    General:
        Optimize algorithms

Here are ideas/tips to improve pathfinder.py:

    Specific:
        Use deque instead of list for specific algorithms
        Add Tr√©maux pathfinder (https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm)
        Add Chain pathfinder (https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm)
        Add Jump Point Search (https://zerowidth.com/2013/05/05/jump-point-search-explained.html)

    General:
        Optimize algorithms
